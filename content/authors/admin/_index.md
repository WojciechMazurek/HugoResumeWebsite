I am a second-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Duke University](https://www.https://ece.duke.edu/.edu/) advised by [Professor Ken Brown](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/kenneth-brown). My broad area of research is Quanutm Computing, and my main focus is working on support software for ion trap quantum computers. I am busy contributing to [Duke ARTIQ Extensions](https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax) (DAX), an open-source project from Duke University focused on adding traditional software abstractions on top of [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/), a leading control system for quantum information experiments. The goal of the project is to provide a framework that enables the development of modular and transparently layered software for quantum control systems.

I aim to expand DAX further, such as by adding realistic simulation of errors characterized by our actual quantum systems at Duke University. There already exist plans for a middle-level language called DAX.program that sits between higher-level languages such as Qiskit and DAX. My other research interests include strategies for compilation from higher-level languages such as Qiskit to DAX.program as well as optimization strategies for compiling DAX.program to DAX and ARTIQ, and the corresponding system pulses that come with it.
